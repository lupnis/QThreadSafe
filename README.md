# QThreadSafe
thread-safe wrappers for some popular types in qt

Wrappers are constructed simply adding a mutex, ;P

I'm a newbie to qt and c++, perhaps there are some better ways to implement this.

This library is used in some of my projects, and may be all overwritten. stay tuned :)


the library only contains headers for now, so don't care about the build type of this project, this project even doesn't need to be builtðŸ˜®
